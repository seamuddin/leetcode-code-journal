# 🚀 LeetCode Multi-Language Solutions Library

A clean, organized, and scalable repository containing **LeetCode solutions** in multiple programming languages.  
Each language has its own dedicated folder with structured problem files, explanations, and optimized approaches.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to create a **centralized, multi-language learning hub** for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).  

This repository helps you:

### ✔ Build a long-term DSA reference  
Each problem is stored in a consistent, easy-to-search structure for future review.

### ✔ Learn problem-solving patterns  
Solutions are written clearly, often with multiple approaches (bruteforce → optimal).

### ✔ Compare logic across languages  
See how the same problem is solved in **C++, Python, JavaScript**, and more.

### ✔ Prepare for coding interviews  
All solutions include clean code and complexity analysis, ideal for interview revision.

### ✔ Maintain professional-level code organization  
A standardized naming format ensures scalability as the repository grows.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

This repository organizes problems **by programming language**, not by problem number.  
Each language has its own folder:

├── cpp/
│ ├── 0001-two-sum.cpp
│ ├── 0002-add-two-numbers.cpp
│ └── README.md
├── python/
│ ├── 0001-two-sum.py
│ ├── 0002-add-two-numbers.py
│ └── README.md
├── javascript/
│ ├── 0001-two-sum.js
│ └── README.md
└── README.md <-- (you are reading this)



### Why this structure?
- Easy to browse all problems solved in a specific language  
- Great for interview preparation when practicing in a target language  
- Cleaner than mixing all solutions in a single folder  
- Perfect for a **multi-language LeetCode library**

---

## 📘 What Each Language Folder Contains

Every language folder (e.g., `/cpp`, `/python`) includes:

- **Problem solutions**  
- A **README.md** listing:
  - Available problems  
  - Approaches  
  - Notes & explanations  

Example folder README skeleton:

```md
# C++ LeetCode Solutions

### Available Problems
- [0001 - Two Sum](0001-two-sum.cpp)
- [0002 - Add Two Numbers](0002-add-two-numbers.cpp)

### Notes
- All solutions follow optimal or near-optimal approaches.
- Each file includes complexity analysis.
